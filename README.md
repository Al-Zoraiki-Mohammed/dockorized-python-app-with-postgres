# dockorized-python-app-with-postgres

* This project serves as a practical introduction to Docker, demonstrating how to containerize a simple Python application that connects to a PostgreSQL database. The primary aim is to learn the fundamentals of Docker, including containerization, service orchestration with Docker Compose, and the management of persistent data using Docker volumes.

* In this project, we will set up a PostgreSQL database and a Python application using Docker Compose. The Python application (app.py) will establish a connection to the PostgreSQL database running within a Docker container. It will create a sample database and a table, populate it with sample data, and validate the data insertion.
